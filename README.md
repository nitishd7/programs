Single File Programs Repository

	Description:

		This is my repository of programs with the objective to have a quick handy reference and with no limitations.


	Program Execution - Deviations from single file implementations:

		gcc ds_stack_impl_c.c ds_queue_impl_c.c ds_binary_tree_impl_c.c algo_expr_eval_with_stack_c.c -o algo_expr_eval_with_stack_c.exe

		gcc ds_binary_search_tree_impl.c ds_binary_search_tree_prgm.c -o ds_binary_search_tree_c.exe

		gcc ds_queue_impl.c ds_queue_prgm.c -o ds_queue_c.exe

		gcc algo_word_dictionary_impl.c algo_word_dictionary_prgm.c -o algo_word_dictionary_c.exe
